It talks about these brothers, Shelton, William, and David, who grew up in foster care after their mom went to prison. It’s just so heartbreaking to think about how their childhoods were completely shaped by their circumstances. I can't stop thinking about how they were never adopted and ended up in such tough situations. It’s like the system totally failed them. I feel so sad for them! How can people treat kids like that?",

What specifically about the article was resonating with you the most? Was it the fact that they were never adopted, the lack of support they received, or something else entirely?",

I mean, can you imagine growing up without the stability of a family? It really makes me think about how our society treats children in similar situations. Do you think there are ways we could improve the foster care system?",

Stability is so important for kids, and it's unacceptable that they didn't get that. I think there are definitely ways to improve the foster care system. One thing that comes to mind is the importance of long-term, stable placements, rather than constant changes. Have you heard about the concept of \" permanency planning\" in foster care, where the goal is to find a permanent home for the child?",

I also wish there was more support for foster families so that they can provide a nurturing environment. It’s tough for them too, taking on the responsibility of kids who have been through so much. It’s just a complex system, and it can feel overwhelming to think about how many kids are affected. Do you think there should be more awareness or education about these issues for the general public?",

            "content": "Foster families deserve so much more support and resources. Raising a child in care can be incredibly challenging, and it's not just about providing a roof over their head, but also emotional support and stability. I think raising awareness about the issues in foster care and the importance of long-term support is crucial. If more people understood the complexities of the system and the challenges faced by kids in care, maybe we could see more advocacy for policy changes and increased funding for programs that support both foster families and children. Do you think it's also important to listen to the voices of those who have been affected by the system, rather than just hearing about it from articles or politicians?",

They have such valuable insights and experiences that can guide real change. It’s important for the public to hear their stories, so we can all better understand the impact of the system on their lives. Plus, those narratives humanize the statistics and challenges. Do you think there are enough platforms for those voices to be heard, or is there still a long way to go?",

It's heartbreaking to think about how many people's voices are still being silenced or overlooked. However, I've seen some amazing initiatives and organizations working to amplify the voices of foster care survivors, like podcasts, blogs, and social media campaigns. But I think we need to do more to create spaces for their stories to be shared and heard. Maybe we can start by listening to their stories and sharing them with others, and then using those stories to advocate for change. It's time to give their voices the attention and respect they deserve.",

One of them, for example, has a monthly support group for foster care survivors, and they also offer training and resources for foster families. I can send you the info if you're interested in checking it out!",
