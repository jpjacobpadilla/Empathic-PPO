I can't stop thinking about how their childhood was just a series of foster homes and struggles. Like, losing their mother at such a young age and then ending up in prison — it made me so sad. It feels so unfair that they had to go through all of that. How do you even process something like that? 😢",

It's amazing that Shelton and his brothers have been able to turn their lives around and create such amazing content together. Can you tell me more about what specifically about their story is hitting you the hardest? Is it the idea of having to deal with foster care and homelessness at such a young age, or something else entirely?",

It feels like they never really had a fighting chance. And the fact that they ended up in prison? It’s like the system failed them in so many ways. I can’t help but think about how many kids are going through similar experiences right now. It just feels so heavy. Have you ever thought about how our upbringing shapes who we become?",

I totally agree with you that the system failed them in so many ways. It's like, we know that foster care and homelessness can be devastating, but to see it happen to kids who are already so vulnerable... it's just heartbreaking. And I love what you said about how our upbringing shapes who we become - it's so true. I think it's especially important for us to be aware of this and try to support kids who are going through similar experiences. It makes me wonder, do you think that Shelton and his brothers are an example of resilience, or do you think their experiences have left them with some lasting scars?",

Their story shows incredible resilience because they've managed to build their lives despite everything. But I can't help but think about the lasting effects of their experiences. It must be so tough to shake off the weight of a childhood like that, even if you do find success later in life. It makes me wonder how they cope with those scars every day. Do you think it’s helpful for them to share their story publicly? Like, does it help in their healing process or does it just keep reopening old wounds?",

I've read that Shelton has spoken publicly about how sharing their story has actually helped them process their emotions and come to terms with their past. It's like, by sharing their story, they're able to validate their experiences and connect with others who may have gone through similar things. But at the same time, it's also possible that sharing their story can reopen old wounds or make them feel vulnerable all over again. It's a delicate balance, I think. Do you think that by hearing about their story, you're somehow connecting with them on a deeper level, or is it more of a surface-level emotional response for you?",

It’s like I can empathize with their struggles and understand that they’re not just statistics; they’re real people who have faced unimaginable challenges. Seeing their resilience inspires me, but it also makes me think about the broader issues in society. It’s hard not to feel a mix of admiration and sadness. I wonder how many other untold stories are out there that we don’t hear about. Do you feel like this article has changed your perspective on issues related to foster care or the justice system?",

It's easy to get caught up in the abstract issues, but hearing Shelton's story makes it feel more personal and human. And I totally agree with you that there are likely many untold stories out there that we don't hear about. This article has definitely made me think more critically about the foster care system and the ways in which it can fail children. It's also made me think about the ways in which we can support people who have experienced trauma and are trying to rebuild their lives. But at the same time, it's also made me realize how much more we need to do to address the systemic issues that lead to kids like Shelton ending up in foster care and prison. It feels like a big problem, and I'm not sure where to start, but hearing their story has definitely given me a sense of urgency.",

I think it’s great that you’re reflecting on how to support those in the system and understand the bigger picture.

It could be a way to channel that feeling of wanting to help into something actionable. Have you ever looked into volunteering or supporting any organizations like that?",

I know it's a lot to take on, but I feel like every small step counts, and it's worth exploring. I've heard that organizations like Big Brothers Big Sisters and the Boys and Girls Clubs of America do great work with foster youth, and there are also local organizations that provide job training and mentorship programs for people re-entering the community. Maybe we could look into those together? It might be a good way to channel our feelings into something concrete and make a difference in a tangible way.",
