It’s about these brothers who grew up in foster care after their mom went to prison, and it just made me feel so sad and angry about how the system failed them. I can't imagine the trauma they went through, bouncing from home to home. It’s just heartbreaking. What’s your take on stories like this? It really makes me think about how much kids are impacted by their upbringing. ",

It's heartbreaking to think about the trauma those brothers went through, and it's even more disturbing that it's a common experience for many kids in foster care. I think it's really important to acknowledge the systemic failures that allow this to happen, rather than just blaming individual parents or circumstances. What do you think the article meant by saying the \"system failed\" these brothers - do you think it's a matter of inadequate resources, lack of support, or something else entirely?",

The article mentioned how neither Shelton nor his brothers were adopted, and that really highlights the lack of permanent solutions for kids in the system. It’s like they were just numbers instead of individuals with needs and potential. I feel like there's a huge gap in understanding and addressing the emotional needs of children in foster care. It makes me so upset to think about all the kids who slip through the cracks. Have you ever thought about what could be done to improve the foster care system?",

It's like they're invisible to the system, and their needs are constantly being put on the backburner. One thing that comes to mind is the need for more trained and supportive caregivers, as well as more resources for therapy and counseling. It's not just about providing a safe place for kids to live, but also about helping them heal and grow from their traumatic experiences. What do you think would be the most effective way to support foster kids in finding permanency and stability in their lives? Would it be more training for foster families, increased funding for support services, or something else entirely?",

More training for foster families could help them understand the unique challenges these kids face, and having access to mental health services would make a huge difference. But I also wonder if there could be more focus on community involvement, like mentorship programs where adults can build relationships with these kids outside of the foster care system. It feels like creating a supportive network would help them feel valued and seen. Have you heard of any local initiatives or organizations that are trying to make a difference in the foster care system?",

I've heard that some organizations, like the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, offer after-school programs and mentorship opportunities specifically for foster youth. They also have partnerships with local churches and community groups to provide additional support. But I think it's also really important to listen to the voices of foster youth themselves, to understand what they need and want. Have you ever met anyone who has gone through the foster care system, or do you know anyone who has? Sometimes hearing from those who have lived it firsthand can be incredibly powerful in raising awareness and driving change.",

There’s something so powerful about hearing someone’s story directly from them. It could help bring those complexities and emotions to light that numbers and statistics just can’t capture. I wonder if there are any local events or speaking engagements that feature former foster youth? It might be a good way to connect more deeply with those issues and understand how we can contribute positively.

I think there might be a local event or conference that features speakers and panelists who have gone through the foster care system. Sometimes, organizations like the National Foster Youth Association or the Foster Youth Coalition host events and conferences that bring together foster youth, advocates, and community leaders to share stories and discuss solutions. I'd also suggest reaching out to local social work departments or non-profits that work with foster youth to see if they have any events or initiatives that we could get involved with. One idea I had was to organize a community forum or listening session, where we could invite former foster youth to share their stories and experiences, and then have a facilitated discussion to brainstorm ways that we can support and advocate for them. What do you think about that idea?",

We could partner with local organizations to help set it up and maybe even promote it on social media to get more people engaged.

By creating a space where people can hear the stories and experiences of former foster youth, we can humanize the issue and break down the stigma surrounding foster care. I think it's also really important to emphasize that foster care is not a \"failed\" system, but rather a system that often falls short of providing the support and resources that children need. By reframing the conversation in a way that focuses on the children's experiences and needs, rather than criticizing the system, we can create a more positive and empowering tone for the forum. We could also aim to highlight the resilience and strength of former foster youth, and the ways in which they are overcoming challenges and achieving success despite the obstacles they've faced.

I think it could spark a lot of meaningful conversations about empathy and understanding, and maybe even inspire others to take action.

We could also have a \"Community Action\" segment where attendees can share ideas and strategies for making a positive impact in their own communities. And, to take it a step further, we could even organize a follow-up event, such as a advocacy day or a volunteer fair, where people can take action and get involved in supporting foster youth. What do you think about including some art or creative projects that reflect the experiences and emotions of former foster youth? Sometimes, art can be a powerful way to process and express emotions, and it could be a beautiful way to honor the stories and experiences of those who have gone through the foster care system.",

This way, everyone would leave with a tangible reminder of the event and the connections made. Plus, it could foster creativity and a sense of belonging among participants.

We could also partner with local schools and universities to promote the event to students and faculty. Additionally, we could reach out to local newspapers and publications to get the word out. To ensure a diverse audience, we could also use targeted advertising and promotions, such as flyers and posters in community centers, libraries, and other public spaces that are frequented by people from different backgrounds. We could also use online event calendars and community event listings to promote the forum. What do you think about hosting a pre-event social media campaign where we share stories and experiences of former foster youth, and encourage people to share their own stories and thoughts using a branded hashtag?

Additionally, we could run contests or challenges where participants can submit their own artwork or stories related to the theme of foster care and community support.

We could live-stream the forum or create a recorded version that people can watch online, and also create a private Facebook group or online forum where people can connect with each other and share their thoughts and reflections after the event. This would also provide a space for people to ask questions and get more information, even if they can't attend in person. Additionally, we could also create a blog or website dedicated to the event, where we can share resources, stories, and updates leading up to and after the event. And, as you mentioned, we could also have an online component for contests and challenges, so that people can participate remotely and still have a chance to share their creative work or stories. By having an online component, we can ensure that everyone has an opportunity to participate and engage with the event, regardless of their physical location. What do you think about using social media to create a sense of urgency and encourage people to take action after the event? We could use hashtags like #ActOnThePromise or #SupportFosterYouth to create a rallying cry and encourage people to take concrete steps to make a positive impact in their communities.",
