I can't believe how much trauma they went through just because their mom was sent to prison when they were so young. It’s so unfair that the system failed them so many times. I feel a mix of sadness and frustration thinking about how their lives turned out. Have you ever come across stories like this that just stick with you?",

Was it the way they were handled by the foster care system, or the fact that their mom was sent away when they were so young? It's interesting that you mention a mix of sadness and frustration - are those emotions competing with each other, or do you think one is more dominant for you right now?",

It’s just so tragic that the system that’s meant to protect kids failed them instead. It's hard to wrap my head around how many kids go through similar situations. Sometimes I wonder what could have been different for them if they had more support. Do you think there’s something we can do as a society to help improve the system for these kids?",

Have you considered the fact that systemic change often requires a multi-faceted approach, involving policy changes, community resources, and individual support? For example, some organizations are working to provide stable, long-term foster care, while others are advocating for restorative justice and rehabilitation programs for parents who have made mistakes. What do you think would be a crucial step in addressing this issue?",

It can be easy to overlook these issues if we don’t see them firsthand. I also wonder how much more support foster families need; it must be tough to take in children who have experienced trauma and help them heal. Do you think there’s enough public conversation about the challenges foster families face?",

Unfortunately, I think there is still a lot of stigma surrounding foster care and the families who take in these children. I've seen stories where foster families have spoken out about the lack of support and resources they receive, only to be met with criticism and skepticism. It's like their experiences are being dismissed or minimized. Do you think that's part of what's so infuriating for you - the feeling that their stories are being ignored or dismissed?",

It’s like we only focus on the negative aspects of foster care without recognizing the hard work and love that many foster families put into their roles. I think if we listened more to their experiences and struggles, it could foster empathy and understanding. Plus, it might encourage more people to get involved and help. Have you ever thought about how you might want to contribute or support foster care initiatives in your own life?",

As for me, I've actually been thinking about volunteering at a local organization that supports foster youth. I'd love to get a better understanding of the work they do and see how I can make a practical difference. What do you think would be a great way for someone to get involved and make a positive impact?",

I've always been drawn to organizations that provide wraparound services, like housing, education, and job training, to help foster youth break the cycle of trauma. It's amazing how a stable, supportive environment can make all the difference. I've also been thinking about helping out with awareness events or campaigns, maybe even starting a social media group to share stories and resources. What do you think about the idea of amplifying the voices of foster youth themselves - could they be the ones leading the way in advocating for change?",

When they share their stories, it can create a powerful connection and help others understand the realities they face. Plus, it gives them a sense of empowerment and agency, which is so important. I think involving them in advocating for their own needs can help shape policies that actually work for them.

They also have programs in place to support foster youth in creating their own advocacy campaigns and policy changes. I'm thinking of reaching out to them to see if I can get involved and support their efforts. It's so important that we're giving foster youth the tools and resources they need to take control of their own narratives and advocate for their own needs.

I think one of the most important things we can do is listen to foster youth without judgment and provide them with safe spaces where they can express themselves. That can empower them to share their stories authentically. Supporting their initiatives and giving them a platform to speak—whether through social media, community events, or even art—can help them reach a wider audience. Plus, it’s essential to ensure that adults in the system are receptive and willing to advocate alongside them. Do you think involving more people from the community could help create those safe spaces for foster youth?",

I think community events, like art exhibitions or spoken word performances, could be a great way to bring people together and amplify the voices of foster youth. It's also important to have community leaders and influencers who can help spread the word and create a sense of solidarity around this issue. Having a diverse group of adults who can advocate alongside foster youth could also help break down the power dynamics and create a more inclusive and equitable system. What do you think about the idea of creating a community of advocates who can support foster youth in a long-term way, rather than just a one-time event or volunteer opportunity?",

It’s all about fostering ongoing relationships and consistent support rather than just one-off initiatives. Regular meetups, workshops, or even mentorship programs could help strengthen those connections and really empower foster youth to thrive. Plus, it creates a sense of belonging and community that so many of them might have missed out on growing up. How do you envision starting something like that? Would it be more grassroots, or do you think it could partner with existing organizations?",

Maybe we could start by reaching out to local foster families and youth who are already doing amazing work, and seeing if they'd be interested in being part of a larger network. We could also explore social media platforms and online forums to connect with others who are passionate about this issue. As for existing organizations, it might be worth reaching out to some of the ones I mentioned earlier, like the one I found that's already working to amplify the voices of foster youth. By building relationships with them and learning from their experiences, we could potentially create a more cohesive and effective movement. What do you think about the idea of creating a shared online space, like a private Facebook group or forum, where foster youth and advocates can connect, share resources, and support one another?",
