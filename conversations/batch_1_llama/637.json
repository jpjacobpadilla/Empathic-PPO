It tells the story of Shelton McElroy and his brothers who were in foster care and ended up in prison. Like, itâ€™s heartbreaking to see how their childhood experiences shaped their lives. I can't stop thinking about how the system failed them. It makes me feel so frustrated and sad. How can people let this happen?",

Is it the fact that the system failed Shelton and his brothers, or is it that you feel like there are so many kids in similar situations, and it's just not being addressed? I want to make sure I understand what's driving your emotions, because I think we can explore this further and maybe even find some ways to process it.",

Shelton and his brothers were just kids, you know? And the fact that they ended up in prison after such a rough start makes me wonder how many other kids end up on a similar path. It's like, where's the support for them? I just feel so helpless thinking about it. Did you ever hear stories like this before?",

It's like, we know that the system is supposed to be in place to protect kids, but when it fails them, it can have devastating consequences. Have you ever thought about what would need to change in the system for kids like Shelton to have a better chance at success? Is it just a matter of more resources, or is it a fundamental shift in how we approach foster care?",

They deserve to be seen and valued, not just as numbers in a system. Itâ€™s heartbreaking to think about how many kids might feel like they donâ€™t matter. I wonder if there are programs out there that really focus on mentorship or creating family-like environments for these kids. It just feels like there should be so much more support for them. Do you think there's a way to get involved in helping kids in the foster care system?",

There are definitely programs and organizations out there that focus on mentorship and creating family-like environments for foster kids. For example, some organizations like Big Brothers Big Sisters or the Boys & Girls Clubs of America have programs that match kids with positive adult role models or provide safe spaces for them to thrive. As for getting involved, there are countless ways to make a difference, from volunteering at local organizations that support foster kids to advocating for policy changes that prioritize their well-being. Would you be interested in learning more about some of those options?",

It feels like if more people were aware of these issues, we could maybe push for some change. Itâ€™s just overwhelming sometimes to think about how to make a real impact, you know? Have you ever volunteered for anything like that or thought about ways you could contribute?",

As for me, I've volunteered at a local non-profit that provides after-school programs for kids in underserved communities, and it was incredibly rewarding. Even small actions can make a big difference, like writing to your representatives or sharing articles like this one with others. Sometimes, just being an advocate for a cause can be a powerful way to contribute. I think it's great that you're considering educating yourself more about the system - knowledge is power, and the more we understand the issues, the better equipped we are to make a difference. Would you be open to looking into some organizations or resources that might help you get started on your learning journey?",

They all have great resources and information on how to get involved. As for me, I've actually been inspired by a lot of people who have spoken out about social justice issues, like Michelle Alexander and Bryan Stevenson. Their work has really opened my eyes to the ways in which systemic inequality can impact people's lives. But I think what really gets me going is reading stories like Shelton's, and seeing the human side of the issue. It's easy to get caught up in statistics and policy talk, but when you hear a story that makes you feel like there's a person behind the numbers, it's hard not to want to take action.",

It connects us on an emotional level, making us want to do something about it. I think it's awesome that you're looking to take action after reading about Shelton's experience. It shows how powerful these narratives can be! Iâ€™m excited for you to dive into those resources. If you find something that really resonates with you, let me know! I'm curious to see what you discover. And who knows, maybe we can even team up to volunteer or advocate together at some point. That could be a great way to channel our feelings into something positive!",

I love the idea of teaming up and volunteering or advocating together - it's always more fun to make a difference with a friend by your side. And I think you're right, personal stories like Shelton's have the power to inspire us to take action in a way that just facts and figures can't. It's amazing how these stories can connect us to the issue on a deeper level. Anyway, I should probably wrap up this convo, but it was so great chatting with you about this.
