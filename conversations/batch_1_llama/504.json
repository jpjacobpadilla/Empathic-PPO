It’s about these three brothers who grew up in the foster system after their mom went to prison. I can’t stop thinking about how they were separated and ended up in such tough situations. It’s just so heartbreaking. Have you ever thought about how the foster care system impacts siblings?",

I haven't thought about the foster care system impacting siblings specifically, but it makes sense that it could have a profound effect on them. What specifically about the article is resonating with you - is it the story of the three brothers, the fact that they were separated, or something else entirely?",

It really makes me think about the emotional toll that must take. I can't imagine growing up without that support system. And it’s not just them — how many other siblings go through this and never get back together? It just seems so unfair. Have you heard any stories about siblings being separated in foster care?",

I remember reading about a case where a set of triplets were separated and it was years before they were reunited, and even then, they had to work through a lot of emotional trauma together. It's like, the system is meant to support families, but in reality, it can be so damaging to the very relationships it's supposed to preserve. Do you think that's something that you're more aware of now because of this article, or has it always been something that you've thought about?",

I’ve always had a general understanding that foster care can be complicated, but seeing it through the lens of siblings really brings it to life. It just makes me wonder about all the unseen struggles these kids face and how those early experiences shape their futures. I keep thinking about what could have been different if they had stayed together. It really reinforces the idea that families come in all forms, and sometimes, it’s the bond between siblings that can be the most important. It makes me appreciate my own family even more. What about you? Does this make you think differently about family dynamics?",

For me, it's made me realize how fragile family bonds can be and how easily they can be disrupted. I think about my own parents and siblings and I'm grateful for the relationships we have, but it also makes me appreciate the importance of nurturing those relationships and being present for each other. It's also made me more aware of the systemic issues that can impact families, not just in foster care but in general. It's interesting how this article has shifted your perspective, but it's also making me reflect on my own relationships and priorities. Do you think there's anything that can be done to prevent or mitigate the effects of sibling separation in foster care, or is it just a reality that we need to be more aware of?",

It would also be great if social workers had more training on the emotional needs of siblings. I feel like there's a lack of awareness about how important those relationships are, and that needs to change. It’s heartbreaking to think about how many kids might feel lost or alone because they can’t be with their siblings. I guess raising awareness and advocating for better policies could be a start. What do you think are some steps we could take as a society to support siblings in the foster care system?",

Having more training for social workers on the emotional needs of siblings could make a huge difference. It's also important to recognize that sibling relationships are not just important for the children, but for the entire family system. I think we need to shift our focus from just providing individual support to families, to providing support for the relationships within families. That could involve policies like sibling reunification, respite care, and sibling support groups. It's also important to engage with the siblings themselves, to listen to their stories and validate their experiences. As a society, we need to recognize the importance of sibling relationships and work to create policies and programs that support them. It's a long-term commitment, but I think it's essential to prioritize the well-being of these children. Have you thought about how we can mobilize resources to support sibling-led advocacy efforts, or is that something that's been on your radar already?",

I haven't thought about it much, but I love the concept of siblings having a voice in their own experiences. Maybe we could support organizations that focus on sibling advocacy or create awareness campaigns to highlight their stories. It could also be beneficial to harness social media to amplify their voices, especially since that’s where a lot of people get their information these days. Plus, I think it would be impactful to engage former foster youth who have experienced sibling separation, as their firsthand stories could really drive the message home. Do you know of any organizations or initiatives that are already working on this, or could we brainstorm some ideas together for how to get involved?",

I think organizations like the National Foster Youth Association and the Alliance for Children and Families have some initiatives that focus on sibling advocacy, but I'm not aware of any specific campaigns or programs that are solely dedicated to sibling-led advocacy. I love the idea of creating awareness campaigns and leveraging social media to amplify the voices of foster youth who have experienced sibling separation. Engaging former foster youth as storytellers and advocates could be incredibly powerful. We could also explore partnerships with influencers, bloggers, and content creators who are passionate about social justice and have a platform to amplify these messages. Additionally, we could look into ways to support sibling-led advocacy groups and provide resources, training, and funding to help them scale their work. I think it's also essential to involve policymakers and government agencies in the conversation, to advocate for policy changes that prioritize sibling placement and support. What do you think about exploring some of the existing organizations and initiatives, and seeing if we can find ways to collaborate or amplify their work?",

Collaboration could lead to more impactful efforts and help us avoid duplicating work that's already out there. Plus, partnering with those who already have connections in the system could make our voices even stronger. Maybe we could start by reaching out to a few organizations to see how they operate, and if they have any volunteer or advocacy opportunities available. We could also brainstorm potential social media campaigns, maybe starting with sharing stories or testimonials from individuals who have experienced sibling separation. It could really shine a light on the issue and start conversations. I’m feeling energized by the idea of making a difference! Have you had any particular organizations in mind that you think we could reach out to?",

I've heard of the National Foster Youth Association's (NFYA) efforts to provide support and resources for foster youth, and they might have some initiatives that align with our goals. I've also come across the Sibling Advocacy Project, which seems to be dedicated to supporting siblings in foster care. We could also reach out to the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform, which has a strong focus on advocating for policies and programs that support children and families. Reaching out to these organizations could give us a better understanding of their work and see if we can find ways to collaborate or amplify their efforts. Sharing stories and testimonials from individuals who have experienced sibling separation could be a powerful way to start conversations and raise awareness. I think it's also essential to keep in mind that this is a long-term effort, and we need to be patient, persistent, and open to learning and growing as we go. What do you think about setting up a meeting or call with some of these organizations to learn more about their work and potential opportunities for collaboration?",

It would give us the chance to ask questions, learn more about their work, and explore how we can get involved. Plus, hearing from people who are already in the trenches could provide us with valuable insights and ideas for our own initiatives. I think we should create a list of questions to guide our conversation, like what their current projects are, any challenges they face, and how we can support their efforts effectively. We could also discuss how they engage with former foster youth and the importance of sharing their stories. Overall, I’m really excited about the potential to connect and collaborate with others who are passionate about this issue.

I think it's essential to be intentional about which organizations we connect with, so we can make the most of our time and resources.\n\nBefore we start reaching out, let's take a moment to review our list of questions and make sure we're covering all the bases.

How do they engage with former foster youth and incorporate their stories in their advocacy efforts?\n4. What are some ways we could effectively support their work?\n5.
