It talks about Shelton McElroy and his brothers growing up in foster care after their mom went to prison. I can't believe how much they went through. It made me feel so sad thinking about how the system fails kids, you know? Like, they just keep getting pushed around instead of finding a real home. It’s heartbreaking. How do people let this happen?",

It sounds like you're feeling a strong sense of injustice and frustration. Can you tell me more about what specifically is resonating with you - is it the lack of support, the fact that the system is supposed to be helping them, or something else entirely?",

I mean, Shelton and his brothers ended up in prison, which feels like a cycle that could have been avoided if they had a proper home environment. It makes me think about how broken some systems are, and how much power we have to change them. Do you think there’s any way to improve things for kids in foster care?",

One thing that comes to mind is the importance of community-based solutions, like family preservation programs or therapeutic foster care. These types of programs can provide more individualized support and connection for kids, rather than just relying on the system. What do you think about the idea of investing in programs that prioritize prevention and early intervention, rather than just treating the symptoms?",

I can’t help but wonder what it would look like if more people got involved in mentoring or supporting foster kids directly. Maybe even creating more awareness about the challenges they face might inspire others to help. Do you think that there's enough awareness out there about what kids in foster care go through? Or is it something that people tend to overlook?",

Unfortunately, many people still don't realize the scope of the challenges that foster kids face, from the emotional struggles to the lack of stability and support. I've heard that the foster care system is often invisible to the public, with many kids being cycled through the system without anyone really knowing what's going on. Creating opportunities for people to get involved directly, like through mentorship programs or volunteering, could definitely help raise awareness and change perceptions. Have you ever considered volunteering or getting involved with an organization that supports foster kids?",

I've actually volunteered with an organization that provides after-school programs for foster kids, and it was incredibly rewarding to see the impact that a small group of dedicated people can have on a child's life. They also offer training and support to help volunteers get started, so you don't have to know exactly what to do. Sometimes, just being present and showing up can make a big difference. Would you be interested in looking into organizations like that, or do you want to explore other options?",

You can search online, check out local non-profits, and look into organizations that are specifically focused on supporting foster youth.

Additionally, you could also look into organizations like Big Brothers Big Sisters or the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, which often have programs specifically for foster youth.

I can't actually look up your zip code or specific local options, but I encourage you to look for organizations in your area that focus on foster care or youth support.

It’d be great to support you as you explore this path. What other kinds of activities or volunteer work are you interested in besides working with foster kids?",

Maybe something like the ACLU or a local advocacy group. But it's great that you're interested in supporting me on this journey, and I'm happy to share my findings with you as I go along!",

It's the realization that these kids are not broken or flawed, but rather, they're being pushed around by a system that's supposed to be helping them. It's heartbreaking, but it's also empowering to know that we can create change from the ground up. I think that's why I'm so drawn to advocating for systemic change - it's a way to acknowledge the problem and work towards creating a more just and equitable system.
