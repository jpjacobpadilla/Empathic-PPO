It’s about these brothers who grew up in the foster care system and ended up facing prison sentences. Their story is just so heartbreaking. I can’t stop thinking about how difficult their lives must have been, bouncing around between homes and never really having a sense of belonging. It made me feel so sad and angry about the system and how it can fail kids like them. What do you think about that kind of situation?",

It's heartbreaking to think about how many kids in foster care have to go through that. Have you thought about how you're feeling - is it just frustration with the system, or are there other emotions that are coming up for you?",

And to think about those brothers being separated and then ending up in such tough situations—it's really overwhelming. It also got me thinking about how many people don’t realize the long-term effects of growing up in foster care. It’s like a cycle that just keeps repeating. Do you think there’s a way to make a difference for kids in those situations?",

One thing that might be helpful is to consider what kind of systemic changes you think would make a difference. For example, are you thinking about advocacy for better support systems for kids in foster care, or maybe addressing the root causes of why kids end up in the system in the first place? Also, have you thought about how you personally can get involved - are there any local organizations or initiatives that you could support or volunteer with?",

It’s just so hard to think about it all. I mean, even volunteering or supporting these organizations feels like just a drop in the bucket compared to the scale of the problem. But I guess every little bit counts, right? I just wish more people cared about these issues. It’s frustrating because it seems like society tends to overlook the needs of these kids. What do you think could change people's mindset about supporting foster kids?",

As for changing people's mindset, I think it's all about raising awareness and sharing personal stories. When we hear about someone's experience, it's hard to stay detached. If more people shared their own experiences, or just listened to and believed the stories of foster kids, I think that could shift people's perception. We also need to challenge the stigma surrounding foster care and the idea that kids who have been in the system are somehow flawed or less deserving of love and support.",

It's so easy to have misconceptions when we don't see the full picture. I think media, like documentaries or articles, can also play a big role in showing the realities of these kids' lives. It's like when we connect with someone's story, it sparks empathy and motivates action. I just wish there was a way to amplify those voices more. Have you ever come across any stories or documentaries that really impacted you in that way?",

One that comes to mind is the documentary \"The Kids Are Alright\" about the foster care system in America. It's a really powerful and intimate look at the lives of foster kids and the people working to support them. Another example is the story of Terry Galloway, a foster kid who went on to become a successful author and advocate. His story is just incredible - it's a testament to the resilience of kids in the system and the importance of believing in them. I think stories like these are so important in humanizing the issue and showing people that foster kids are not just statistics, but real people with hopes, dreams, and struggles.",

For me, it's about recognizing that I have a platform and a privilege to be able to amplify these voices and help bring attention to the issue. It's a reminder that our individual actions can add up to make a bigger difference. And I think that's something that's really inspiring about the stories of foster kids like Terry Galloway - they're proof that with hard work, determination, and support, anyone can overcome adversity and achieve their dreams. It's a powerful message that I think can inspire others to take action and make a difference in their own way.",

I think that's so important - when we're passionate about an issue, we're more likely to stick with it and make meaningful changes. For me, it's about using my platform to share stories and raise awareness about foster care and the importance of supporting kids in the system. I'm also thinking about volunteering with local organizations that work with foster youth and advocating for policy changes that would benefit them. But I also think it's just about being a good listener and advocate for friends and family who may not be aware of the issue or the resources available. Sometimes, all someone needs is someone to believe in them and help them see that they're not alone.",

I think it would be really powerful to bring together people from different backgrounds and perspectives to talk about this issue and brainstorm ways to make a difference.
