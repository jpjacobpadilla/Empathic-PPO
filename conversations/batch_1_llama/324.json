It follows the story of Shelton McElroy, who grew up bouncing around foster homes after his mom went to prison. I can’t believe the circumstances that shaped his life. It’s just so heartbreaking to think about how these kids are affected by the system. It made me feel so much empathy for him and his brothers. What do you think about the foster care system?",

I'm still waiting to read it, but I can imagine how heartbreaking it must be to think about the struggles Shelton and his brothers faced. I do have some thoughts on the foster care system, though - I've always been concerned about the lack of support and resources for kids in these situations. It seems like the system is designed to provide a temporary solution, but it's not always equipped to address the long-term effects of trauma and instability. What do you think is the most pressing issue with the foster care system, from what you've read so far?",

Shelton's story shows how many of them are moved from one place to another, which can really mess with their sense of belonging. I mean, how can they ever feel secure when their lives are so disrupted? And it’s so sad to see that the chances of finding a loving adoptive family dwindle as they get older. It’s like they’re set up to fail. It just makes me wonder how many potential futures are lost because of this system. Have you heard any personal stories or experiences related to foster care that stuck with you?",

I've heard stories about kids who were adopted later in life, only to struggle to form healthy attachments with their new families due to the trauma and instability of their previous experiences. It's like you said, they're set up to fail. One story that comes to mind is of a woman who was adopted at a young age, but as she got older, she began to experience anxiety and depression due to feelings of disconnection from her roots and the trauma of her past. It's stories like these that highlight the need for more comprehensive support systems for kids in foster care. What do you think can be done to address this lack of support and provide kids with the stability and nurturing environments they deserve?",

It would be great if there were more training for foster parents to help them understand trauma and how to create a nurturing environment. Also, promoting awareness and advocacy around the experiences of foster youth could help shift public perception and drive more people to become foster or adoptive parents. It’s so important for these kids to have a voice and for society to recognize their struggles. It just feels like there’s so much work to do to create a system that truly supports them. Have you thought about what you can do, even as an individual, to help raise awareness or support foster youth?",

I also think that amplifying the voices of foster youth and their advocates is crucial. One thing I've been thinking about is volunteering with an organization that supports foster youth, either by mentoring a kid, helping with events, or simply advocating for policy changes. I've also been considering starting a small fundraiser or campaign to raise awareness about the issues faced by foster youth. But I think the most important thing I can do is just listen and amplify the voices of those who are already working on this issue. I want to make sure that I'm not speaking over or for foster youth, but rather using my privilege to amplify their stories and help bring attention to the issues they face. Have you considered how you can use your own platform, whether it's social media or your community, to help raise awareness about foster care and advocate for these kids?",

I really want to create a space where people feel encouraged to get involved, whether it's fostering, donating, or even just educating themselves about the system.

Collaborating with local organizations is also a fantastic way to build credibility and reach a wider audience. One idea that might be effective is to create a social media challenge or campaign that encourages people to share their own stories, photos, or videos about foster care and adoption. You could use a hashtag and tag local organizations and influencers to help spread the word. Another idea is to create a Facebook group or online community where people can connect, ask questions, and share resources. You could also consider hosting a local event or webinar to educate people and inspire them to get involved. What do you think about starting with a smaller, more intimate goal, like creating a monthly social media series that highlights a different foster youth's story or experience? Sometimes, starting small can help build momentum and create a sense of community around the issue.",

Highlighting a different foster youth's story each month would not only give people a more personal connection to the issue, but it would also create an ongoing conversation around foster care. Plus, it could inspire others to share their stories or get involved in some way. You could even include a call to action at the end of each post, directing people to ways they can help or learn more. I think creating that sense of community and continuous engagement is key! I’m excited to see how this could evolve! Have you thought about which stories you'd want to start with, or any specific organizations you might want to partner with?",

His story is a great representation of the complexities and challenges of the foster care system, and it could help spark a lot of discussion and empathy. As for partnering with organizations, I think it would be great to reach out to local foster care agencies, adoption organizations, and advocacy groups to see if they'd be willing to share their expertise, resources, and networks. We could also consider partnering with influencers or bloggers who have a following in the foster care community to help amplify the message. One organization that comes to mind is the National Foster Youth Association, which advocates for the rights and needs of foster youth. They might be a great resource to tap into. What do you think about reaching out to Shelton McElroy himself, if possible? I think his story would be incredibly powerful, and it could help humanize the issue in a really meaningful way.",

Plus, having his voice included from the start might inspire more foster youth to share their own experiences. \n\nAs for organizations, it might be helpful to create a list of potential partners, including local ones, that align closely with the mission of the series. I think it could also be beneficial to feature stories from the broader community, not just individuals but also foster families and advocates, to highlight different perspectives on the challenges and successes within the system.\n\nI'm really excited to see where this goes!

Creating a list of potential partners is a great idea, and reaching out to organizations that align closely with the mission of the series would help build credibility and support. To start making this happen, I think I should begin by researching organizations that align with the mission and creating a list of potential partners. I should also start brainstorming ideas for the first story and the format of the series, and reach out to Shelton McElroy's team to see if he's interested in sharing his story. Additionally, I should start thinking about the social media strategy and how to create a consistent and engaging voice for the series.

Plus, creating a dedicated space might help foster a sense of community and encourage discussions around the issues. I think it would also be helpful to include a section where people can share their own stories or experiences related to foster care, which could further engage the audience and create a platform for voices that often go unheard. \n\nOnce the page is set up, you could invite friends and family to help spread the word and gather initial interest.

As for the timeline, I think it would be great to launch the first story and project page within the next 6-8 weeks. This would give us enough time to set up the page, invite friends and family to help spread the word, and gather initial interest before launching the first story. Additionally, having a solid foundation in place before launching the first story would help ensure that the page and the series have a strong and dedicated following from the start. What do you think about setting a specific launch date for the series, such as the spring or fall season, when people are more likely to be thinking about adoption and foster care?",

That would give us a solid timeframe to get everything ready, from creating the project page to reaching out to Shelton and collaborating with organizations.\n\nHaving a clear launch date could also create a sense of urgency and motivate us to work towards that goal. Once we have that date in mind, we can break down the tasks we need to accomplish each week leading up to the launch. How does that timeline sound to you?

I also think it would be helpful to set some benchmarks for the number of followers and engagement we want to achieve before the launch date. This will give us a sense of how successful we're being and help us adjust our plan as needed. What do you think about setting a \"soft launch\" period of 2-3 weeks before the official launch date, where we can test the waters, get feedback, and make any necessary adjustments before the big launch?",
