It tells the story of Shelton McElroy and his brothers who grew up bouncing around foster homes after their mom went to prison. I can't even imagine how difficult that must have been for them, being separated and then facing the struggles of the system. It made me really emotional thinking about how their childhood has affected their lives, especially with Shelton ending up in prison too. It just feels so unfair. What do you think?",

It's heartbreaking to think about the trauma and instability those brothers must have faced, and that it's still having a ripple effect in Shelton's life today. Can you tell me more about what specifically resonated with you about Shelton's story? Was it the fact that he ended up in prison, or something else entirely?",

Like, how the system didn't really help them find a way out but instead seemed to push them deeper into those struggles. Shelton's experience made me think about how many kids might be trapped like that. It’s so frustrating to realize that some people just get stuck in this cycle because of circumstances beyond their control. It makes me wonder what could have been done differently for them. Do you think there are any solutions for the foster care system that could help break that cycle?",

I think that's a crucial part of processing emotions like this - acknowledging the injustices and trying to imagine solutions. One thing that comes to mind is the importance of providing long-term, stable support and resources for kids in foster care. Instead of just moving them from one foster home to another, what if we prioritized finding permanent families, or providing them with the education, job training, and mental health support they need to break the cycle? It's also about addressing the systemic issues that lead to kids ending up in the system in the first place - poverty, lack of access to healthcare, and more. Do you think there's a way to hold people in power accountable for these systemic failures, or is it more about individual solutions?",

It feels like there’s a need for both systemic change and individual support. Maybe it starts with raising awareness and advocating for policy changes, but at the same time, we need community programs that step in and help each child. I wonder if there's a way to combine both approaches—like involving communities in mentoring or supporting foster kids while also pushing for laws that make a real difference. Have you heard of any programs or initiatives that are actually making progress in this area? It seems like there are some people out there really fighting for change.",

I've come across a few programs that are doing just that - like the Mentoring With Purpose organization, which pairs community members with foster kids and provides them with support and guidance. They're also working to advocate for policy changes at the local and national levels. Another example is the National Foster Youth Institute, which is working to support foster youth in education, employment, and housing, while also pushing for policy reforms to improve the foster care system. It's inspiring to see people and organizations taking a grassroots approach to creating change. Do you think there's a way to engage more people in this conversation, especially those who may not be directly affected by the foster care system, but can still play a role in advocating for change?",

I think sharing stories, like Shelton's, can be an impactful way to humanize the issue and spark empathy. Maybe hosting community events, workshops, or even social media campaigns could help spread the word and get people talking about it. Collaborating with schools and local organizations could also raise awareness among younger generations, making them more conscious of these issues. It’s all about creating connections and showing that everyone has a part to play in advocating for change. Do you think there's a particular approach or platform that would resonate most with people in your community?",

Creating a campaign that uses storytelling, hashtags, and user-generated content can help spread the word and create a sense of momentum. But it's not just about sharing Shelton's story - it's about creating a platform for other people to share their own experiences and perspectives. Maybe a local Facebook group or online forum could be a good place to start, where people can share their thoughts and connect with others who are passionate about creating change. I've also heard that events like marches, rallies, and town halls can be really effective in bringing people together and raising awareness. What do you think about using art or creative expression to tell the story of foster care and the impact it has on individuals?",

Art can evoke powerful emotions and help people connect with the stories in a way that statistics and facts sometimes can't. Maybe a community art project or exhibition that highlights the experiences of those in the foster care system could really resonate with people. It would allow artists to express their feelings about the issue and encourage viewers to engage with the subject matter on a deeper level. Plus, it could spark conversations and bring in a diverse audience from the community. I think storytelling through art could be a really effective way to bridge the gap between those who are directly affected and those who might not understand the struggles. Do you have any specific ideas for how to kick off something like that in your area?",

Starting a community art project or exhibition could be a great way to bring people together and raise awareness about the issue. One idea I had was to reach out to local schools, community centers, and art organizations to see if they'd be interested in hosting a free event or exhibition featuring art from foster youth or those who have been impacted by the system. Maybe we could also partner with local businesses to sponsor the event or donate materials. To kick it off, we could start by gathering stories and testimonials from people who have been affected by foster care, and then use those to inspire the art. We could also invite local artists to create their own pieces in response to the stories, and then exhibit them in a public space. What do you think about using social media to promote the event and encourage people to share their own stories and art?",

It’d be a great way to include those who may not be able to attend in person. Plus, we could encourage local influencers to spread the word and get their followers engaged. I think creating a sense of community around the event would really amplify its impact. Do you think there are local groups or influencers who'd be excited to collaborate with us on this?",

We could also consider partnering with local art schools or colleges to involve students and faculty in the project. Maybe we could even host a social media contest where people can share their own artwork or stories, and then display them on a digital platform for everyone to see. The more people who get involved, the bigger the impact. One question I have is, how do you think we can ensure that the voices and stories of the people who are most affected by the foster care system are being heard and centered in this project?",

One way to ensure this is to involve them in the planning process from the beginning.

Bringing them in as co-creators would not only empower them but also help us authentically capture their experiences. Additionally, we could create a space for them to showcase their own art or writings in the exhibition, making sure their perspectives are front and center.

We could also consider reaching out to local high schools or community centers that serve foster youth, to spread the word and invite people to get involved. It might be helpful to have a clear and concise message about the project, explaining how it aims to amplify their voices and create a platform for their stories. What do you think about using a peer-to-peer outreach strategy, where we ask current foster youth or alumni to invite their friends and peers to join the project?",

Additionally, hosting an initial informal gathering or workshop where people can come together, share their experiences, and brainstorm ideas could be a great way to kick things off and build community. I think it’s important to create an environment where they feel safe and valued, so maybe incorporating some icebreaker activities or creative exercises could help break the ice. How do you feel about organizing a casual meet-up to start building those connections?",

Having a casual meet-up could also be a great way to get people's feedback and ideas, and to start building momentum around the project. What do you think about using the initial meet-up as an opportunity to establish a core team of co-creators, who can help take the project forward and ensure that the voices and perspectives of foster youth and alumni are centered throughout the process?",
