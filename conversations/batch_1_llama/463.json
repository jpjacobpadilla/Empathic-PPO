I can’t stop thinking about how they went through so much as kids, bouncing from one foster home to another, and then finding themselves in prison. It feels so unfair that their childhood experiences set them up for such a tough life. What even is the system doing for kids in those situations?",

Can you tell me more about what specifically bothered you about the system's response to their situation? Was it the lack of support, the inefficiencies in the foster care system, or something else entirely? I want to make sure I understand what's bothering you so we can unpack it together.",

They were moved around so much, and instead of providing a stable environment, it felt like they were just shuffled off to different places with no real support. I mean, it’s like they were set up to fail from the start. And then seeing how their experiences in foster care led directly to their prison sentences really got to me. It’s just so frustrating that these kids don’t have a real chance at a better life. How do you think the system could improve?",

I think it's really interesting that you mention \"set up to fail\" - that phrase really speaks to the idea that the system is failing these kids on a fundamental level. One thing that comes to mind is the concept of \"trauma-informed care\" - essentially, providing services and support that take into account the long-term effects of trauma on a child's life. It's not just about providing temporary fixes, but about creating a supportive environment that acknowledges the lasting impact of their experiences. What do you think would need to change in terms of support and services for kids like Shelton and his brothers to have a better chance at breaking the cycle?",

I wonder if having more consistent relationships—like stable foster families who are trained to handle trauma—could make a difference. It’s hard to believe how many kids just fall through the cracks. I also feel like we need to prioritize mental health resources for these kids, so they have access to counseling and support while they're in the system. It's just so heartbreaking to think about how different their lives could have been with a bit more stability and support. Do you think there are enough conversations happening about these issues in society? Or do you think it’s still pretty hidden?",

It's also really important to prioritize mental health resources, especially for kids who have experienced trauma. I think conversations around these issues are starting to gain traction, but I also think there's still a long way to go. It's easy for these issues to get lost in the conversation about crime and punishment, but it's really about understanding that these kids are not failures, they're victims of a system that failed them. I've seen a lot of articles and documentaries lately highlighting the need for reform, but it's clear that we need to keep raising awareness and pushing for change. Do you think there's anything that individuals can do, aside from advocating for policy changes, to make a difference in the lives of kids like Shelton and his brothers?",

Volunteering your time or even donating can have a meaningful impact. Also, fostering or mentoring a child could provide that stability and support that many kids desperately need. It’s all about building a community that cares and is willing to step in where the system falls short. Raising awareness, like we're doing now, is also huge—sharing stories and advocating for change can help shift the narrative. It just feels like we need more people to recognize that every child deserves a chance. What about you? Do you think you'd be interested in getting involved in something like that in the future?",

And I think fostering or mentoring can be a game-changer for kids. It's amazing that you're thinking about building a community that cares - that's exactly what we need. As for me, I've actually been thinking about volunteering at a local youth center. I'd love to get involved in a way that allows me to make a more direct impact on kids' lives. But I think what really resonates with me is the importance of shifting the narrative around foster care and youth services. We need to start seeing these kids as survivors, not failures. It's a powerful message, and I'm glad we're having this conversation. Do you think that by sharing more stories like Shelton's, we can start to break down those stigmas and stereotypes that surround foster care and youth services?",

When people see the real experiences and struggles behind the statistics, it can create empathy and understanding. I think it also helps to challenge the misconceptions that foster kids are just troublemakers or that they don’t deserve a second chance. Every kid has potential, and by showcasing their stories, we can inspire others to care and act. It's all about fostering that connection and understanding, right? I’m so glad we’re having this discussion—it really feels like we’re not just talking about it for the sake of it, but actually brainstorming ways to make a difference. Do you think having more platforms or forums for these conversations would help more people get involved?",

And I think you're spot on about challenging those misconceptions - it's time to start seeing foster kids as individuals with potential, not just statistics. Having more platforms for these conversations would be huge - I think we're already seeing it with social media and online forums, but there's still a need for more dedicated spaces for people to learn and engage with these issues. Maybe something like a podcast or a documentary series could help amplify these stories and inspire more people to get involved. What do you think about the role of social media in raising awareness about these issues? Can platforms like Twitter and Instagram be effective tools for sparking conversations and inspiring action?",

It allows people to share stories quickly and connect with a wider audience. Platforms like Instagram can showcase impactful visuals and personal stories, while Twitter can facilitate discussions and bring in different perspectives. I think the challenge is ensuring that the conversations lead to action rather than just being liked or shared without follow-through.

But when done well, it can be incredibly powerful. I've seen a lot of campaigns on social media that effectively raise awareness about foster care and related issues. One that comes to mind is the #BreakTheCycle campaign, which highlights the experiences of foster youth and advocates for policy changes to support their success. I've also seen a lot of powerful stories and videos on Instagram and Facebook from organizations like the National Foster Youth Association and the Foster Youth Institute, which provide a platform for foster youth to share their voices and experiences. It's amazing to see how social media can be used to amplify marginalized voices and bring attention to issues that might otherwise go unnoticed.

It features stories from former foster youth, foster parents, and advocates, and it really brings the community together to advocate for change. I love how it encourages people to share their own experiences and challenges the stigma surrounding foster care. It’s uplifting to see so many voices uniting for a common cause. I also think platforms like TikTok are emerging as a space where younger generations are sharing their personal stories, which can really resonate. It’s a different kind of storytelling, but it’s raw and authentic. Do you think those platforms have the potential to reach younger audiences who might not be aware of these issues?",

TikTok's short-form format and emphasis on community can make it a really powerful tool for sharing experiences and challenging stigma. I think younger audiences are particularly drawn to TikTok's authenticity and rawness - it's a platform that values individuality and creativity, which can be really powerful for sharing stories that might otherwise go unheard. By leveraging platforms like TikTok and Instagram, we can reach a new generation of advocates who are passionate about making a difference. It's exciting to think about the potential for social media to mobilize a new wave of activism around issues like foster care. Do you think that's something we should be encouraging more - getting younger people involved in the conversation and advocating for change?",

I think it's also a great opportunity to empower them to share their voices and experiences. Getting young people involved helps create a sense of ownership over these issues, and it can inspire them to take action in their own communities. Plus, they often bring fresh perspectives that can challenge the status quo. I'm really excited about the potential for youth activism to shape the future of foster care advocacy. Do you think schools or youth organizations should incorporate discussions about foster care and related issues into their programs to foster awareness and involvement?",

By engaging young people in conversations around these issues, we can empower them to become agents of change and create a sense of ownership over the solutions. And I think incorporating discussions about foster care and related issues into school and youth organization programs is a fantastic way to do just that. It's amazing how much impact a single conversation can have on a young person's perspective and values. By incorporating these discussions into their curriculum or programming, schools and youth organizations can help raise awareness, challenge stigma, and inspire action. It's also a great way to connect the dots between personal experiences and larger social issues, helping young people understand the broader implications of their own stories. By doing so, we can create a ripple effect of compassion, empathy, and understanding that can spread far beyond the classroom or organization.",
