It tells the story of Shelton McElroy and his brothers, who grew up in foster care after their mom went to prison. They never got adopted, and it feels like their lives just kept spiraling from there. It’s heartbreaking to think about how the system failed them. I can't help but feel this deep sadness for them, you know? Like, how can kids be left to fend for themselves like that? It just feels so unfair.",

What is it about their story that's resonating with you the most? Is it the fact that they never got the stability and love they needed, or is it something else entirely?",

            "content": "Yeah, I think it’s mostly the lack of stability and love. It’s just tragic to think they were bounced around from home to home, and instead of finding a family, they ended up in prison. It makes me feel so helpless thinking about how many kids are in similar situations. Like, what kind of future can they really have? And it’s not just them, it’s a whole system that seems to fail at providing support. It’s all just so frustrating! Have you ever thought about how much childhood experiences can shape someone's entire life?",

I've read about research that shows how adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) can affect a person's long-term health, education, and even mental health outcomes. It's like the system is failing them at the most critical stage of development. It's not just the McElroy brothers' story, but also the countless other kids who are struggling to break the cycle of poverty and trauma. Do you think there's anything that can be done to address this systemic failure, or do you feel like it's too ingrained?",

We need more awareness and advocacy for foster care reform, and it really starts with people understanding the struggles these kids face. I wish there were more resources and support systems in place, not just for the kids in foster care, but for their families too. It can feel overwhelming, like it's too big of a problem for any one person to tackle. But then again, every little bit counts, right? Have you ever thought about what you might want to do to help, even in a small way?",

For me, I've thought about volunteering at a local organization that supports foster families, or maybe even advocating for policy changes in our community. But I also think it's just as important to amplify the voices of those who are already working to make a difference. How about you? Are there any specific ways you're thinking of getting involved or using your voice to help?",

I’ve also thought about organizing a fundraiser or awareness event to highlight these issues. It feels empowering to think that even small efforts can help raise awareness and support. Plus, it might inspire others to get involved! Have you seen any organizations in our area that you feel passionate about or that align with what we’re talking about?",

And organizing an event is a great idea too - it can help bring attention to the issue and create a sense of community around it. I actually know of a local organization that does great work with foster youth, and they have a mentorship program that might be a good fit for you. I can send you some info if you're interested. What do you think about using social media to amplify the message and reach a wider audience?",

I think sharing personal stories or statistics about foster care could really resonate with folks and encourage them to get involved. Plus, it’s a platform that can reach so many people quickly. Have you thought about what kind of content you would want to share, or how to engage others in the conversation?",

Maybe we could share some success stories or testimonials from kids who have benefited from mentorship programs, or even just share some fun facts about foster care that people might not know? As for engaging others, I think it would be great to start a conversation on social media using a hashtag, and then encourage others to share their own thoughts and experiences. We could also tag some local organizations or influencers who might be able to amplify the message. What do you think about creating a Facebook event or a petition to collect signatures and show support for foster care reform?",

It might also spark discussions that can lead to more people getting involved. We could brainstorm some catchy hashtags too, to make it easier for people to find and join the conversation. Plus, it could be a fun way to engage our friends and encourage them to share it with their networks. Do you feel like you have the time to dedicate to this kind of project?",

I'm not sure what my schedule will look like, but I'm willing to commit to regular check-ins and updates to keep the momentum going. Plus, I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together and share our skills and expertise to make the project more effective. I'm also thinking that we could reach out to some of our mutual friends who might be interested in getting involved, and see if we can build a team around this project. What do you think about setting up a working group or a core team to help plan and execute the project?",

We can set up regular meetings to brainstorm, plan, and keep each other accountable. Plus, it can be a great way to foster a sense of community among those involved. We should also consider how to promote inclusivity so that we’re hearing from a diverse range of voices, especially those with lived experiences in foster care.

Let's aim to schedule our first meeting for next week, maybe Wednesday evening? And yeah, creating a group chat is a great idea to start coordinating and keeping everyone on the same page. We can also use that chat to collect feedback and suggestions from interested individuals before our first meeting. I think it's a good idea to also reach out to some organizations that work with foster youth and see if they'd be willing to share their expertise and resources with us. What do you think about setting up a clear set of goals and objectives for our working group, and also establishing some basic guidelines for how we'll communicate and make decisions as a team?",

Establishing communication guidelines is also important so that we can have constructive discussions and respect everyone's input. I think it would be helpful to have each member share their skills and what they’d like to contribute, so we can delegate tasks effectively. Maybe we can draft a simple agenda for our first meeting that includes introductions, goal-setting, and brainstorming ideas for our campaign. I can help put that together!
