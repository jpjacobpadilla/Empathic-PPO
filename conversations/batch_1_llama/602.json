It's so heartbreaking to see how their early experiences shaped their lives, especially how they ended up in prison. I can’t stop thinking about how the system failed them and how they weren't able to find a stable family. It’s just so sad, you know?",

Can you tell me more about what specifically about their story is stuck with you? Was it the fact that they were unable to find a stable family, or something else entirely?",

They never had a chance to build a solid foundation. I was thinking about how a little support or a nurturing environment could have made such a difference for them. It really makes you question how the foster care system works and the way it can fail kids who desperately need stability. Have you thought about how difficult it must be for kids in similar situations?",

It's clear that the article has made you think critically about the way kids like Shelton, William, and David were raised. For me, it's heartbreaking to think about how many kids are in similar situations, feeling like they don't have a stable or supportive environment. It's like they're constantly trying to navigate the system, but it's not set up to support them. Have you ever met someone who grew up in foster care, or is this the first time you're hearing about it like this?",

I think reading this article just brought it all to the forefront for me. The idea that a lack of stability and support can lead to such dire outcomes is so frustrating. It makes me want to learn more about how we can help kids in those situations, like maybe volunteering or supporting organizations that focus on fostering or mentoring. What do you think? Would you be interested in looking into that together?",

I'm actually really interested in exploring that further with you. It's not just about volunteering or donating money, it's also about raising awareness and advocating for policy changes that can support kids in foster care. Have you considered reaching out to organizations like the National Foster Youth Association or the Alliance for Children and Families? They might have some great resources and connections that could help us get started.",

Maybe we could look into something like a peer mentoring program, where we could be a positive influence in the lives of kids who are going through similar experiences.
