Itâ€™s about these brothers who grew up in the foster care system after their mom went to prison. I canâ€™t help but feel such a mix of sadness and anger over how they were treated. It's heart-wrenching to think about how their childhood shaped their lives and led them eventually to prison too. Like, how does that even happen? It just feels so unfair. ðŸ˜”",

I can see why you'd feel sad and angry - it's heartbreaking to think about how their childhood experiences might have shaped their adult lives. Can you tell me more about what specifically is resonating with you? Is it the fact that they were in foster care, or the fact that they ended up in prison? What is it about their story that's feeling unfair to you?",

I mean, how can you expect kids to thrive when theyâ€™re moved around so much and not given the support they really need? I just keep thinking about how those experiences must affect their mental health and choices later on. Itâ€™s infuriating that the system fails them like that. Do you think there's a better way to support kids in situations like this?",

It's heartbreaking that the system isn't doing enough to support them. I think one thing that's really interesting is that some countries have implemented policies like \"forever families\" where foster kids can stay with a family for as long as they need, which can really help break the cycle of trauma. Have you heard about any of those programs or initiatives that might be working in other parts of the world?",

It makes so much sense to give kids that stability and long-term support. I wonder if there are any success stories from those kinds of initiatives. It feels like we need to prioritize not just temporary solutions, but long-term care and emotional support for kids who have been through so much. I can't even imagine the impact that would have on their lives. Have you seen any articles or stories that highlight successful programs like that?",

For example, there's a program in the US called \"Foster Grandparents\" that matches older adults with foster kids, providing them with a stable and loving presence in their lives. It's amazing to see how this program has helped these kids feel seen and loved, and even helped them heal from past traumas. I also came across an article about a family in Canada who adopted a foster child and created a \"forever family\" for them, providing a stable and loving home for the past 20 years. It's incredible to see the impact that one family can have on a child's life. Have you considered talking to people who have experience with foster care or adoption to get a more personal perspective on this issue?",

Hearing personal stories from people who have been involved in the foster care system could really deepen my understanding of the challenges and successes. I think it would be eye-opening to see how their experiences shaped their views and what kind of support they found helpful. It's easy to get lost in the statistics but connecting with real people could bring more insight. Have you ever spoken to someone with experience in foster care or adoption? I feel like that could lead to some really powerful conversations!",

They shared with me about the challenges they faced in the beginning, but also the incredible rewards of creating a forever home for their child. What struck me was how much their own experiences with trauma and loss had shaped their perspective and approach to parenting. It's like, they were able to approach their child's needs with a level of understanding and empathy that's hard to replicate with just statistics and policy. I think that's what I love about talking to people who've lived through these experiences - it's like they're speaking truth to power and sharing a level of intimacy and vulnerability that's hard to find in other sources. Would you be interested in setting up a time to talk to this person or connect with others who have experience in foster care or adoption? I think it could be a really powerful way to deepen our conversation and gain a more nuanced understanding of the issue.",

I wonder if we should also ask how they feel about the current foster care system and what specific changes they think would be most impactful. That could lead to some really honest insights. Plus, maybe we could touch on what they wish people understood more about foster care? That could help break down some stereotypes or misconceptions. What do you think?",

Asking about what they wish people understood more about foster care is also a great idea - that could be a really eye-opening conversation, and it might help us challenge some of the common misconceptions that people have about foster care. I think we could also ask about the importance of community and support in their lives, and how that can help mitigate some of the negative effects of foster care.
