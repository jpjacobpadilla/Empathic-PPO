It’s about these three brothers, Shelton, William, and David, who grew up in foster care after their mom went to prison when they were really young. It made me feel so sad thinking about what they went through. Like, they had no stability at all and just kept getting shuffled around. It’s heartbreaking to think how that kind of childhood can lead to a cycle of prison, you know? What’s even worse is that they were never adopted. Ugh, it’s so frustrating!",

The fact that they were never adopted is especially tragic. Can you tell me more about what specifically bothered you about their story? Was it the idea that they were stuck in the system for so long, or something else?",

They didn’t have anyone to really care for them or guide them, and it seems like they were just set up for failure. I can't imagine how that must have felt for them, especially when they were kids. It's like the cycle just continues, and they couldn't break free from it. I really wish there were more resources for kids in foster care to help them succeed. What do you think?",

It's like they're being thrown into a situation without a safety net, and it's no wonder they struggle to break the cycle. I've heard that foster care is often referred to as a \"temporary solution,\" but it feels like it's sometimes the only thing that's available. Do you think the fact that they were never adopted was a deliberate choice, or do you think it's a reflection of the system's inability to provide stable, long-term care?",

I mean, there are so many kids who need loving homes, but the process for finding them can be so complicated and slow. It makes me wonder how many potential families just never even get to hear about these kids. And then, when they age out of the system, they're left to fend for themselves without the skills or support they need. It just seems so wrong. Have you seen any stories about foster care that gave you hope, or do you feel like they mostly lean towards the negative side?",

I actually did come across a story recently about a foster care program that's doing some amazing work to match kids with adoptive families. They're using technology and social media to connect families with kids who need them, and it's really inspiring to see. But, yeah, it's true that those kinds of stories are often less well-known than the ones that highlight the failures of the system. Do you think that's part of why the story about the three brothers got to you so hard - it felt so raw and unvarnished, you know?",

When you read about stories that are more hopeful, it can feel almost surreal when compared to the struggles that others experience. It’s like a reminder that while there are good things happening, the darker stories are still very much alive and affecting real lives. It’s hard to reconcile the two. I think that's why stories like the brothers' resonate so deeply; they serve as a wake-up call to the ongoing issues in the system. Have you ever thought about ways we could actually make a difference or help change things for kids in foster care?",

As for making a difference, I've thought about volunteering with a local organization that supports foster youth, and also advocating for policy changes that would improve the system. But it's easy to feel overwhelmed by the scale of the issue, and I know I'm not alone in feeling that way. Do you think that's part of why you're feeling so frustrated - like, we're not doing enough to make a difference, and it feels like the system is just perpetuating the same problems?",

It makes you wonder if individual efforts really make a dent or if it's just a drop in a bucket. But at the same time, I think every little bit counts, right? Even spreading awareness or supporting local initiatives can help. It’s just tough to balance that feeling of helplessness with the hope that we can contribute somehow. Have you ever felt inspired by someone who’s made an impact in the foster care community?",

And yeah, it's tough to balance feeling helpless with wanting to contribute. One person who comes to mind is a woman named Jennifer Arnold, who became a foster mom to a child who was in the system and helped him heal and thrive. She's also been a vocal advocate for foster care reform and has written a book about her experiences. Her story is really inspiring because it shows that even small actions can make a big difference, and that individual efforts can add up to create real change. Do you think that's something that would motivate you to get involved or make a difference in the foster care community?",

It shows that even one person can make a significant impact in a child's life and that those stories can ripple outwards to inspire others.

Would you be interested in researching some options with me?",

I think it's awesome that you're thinking of getting involved together - having a buddy to support and encourage each other can make a big difference. We could look into organizations like Big Brothers Big Sisters, the Boys and Girls Clubs, or other groups that work with foster youth. We could also search for community events or fundraisers in your area that benefit foster care. What do you think? Should we start by looking into organizations in our local area or something more specific, like mentorship programs?",

We can check out a few that focus on mentorship, since that seems like a meaningful way to make a connection. I think it would be really rewarding to be a part of something like that, especially knowing we could help guide kids who really need support. Plus, it would be great to feel like we’re actively contributing to positive change rather than just feeling frustrated about the issues. Let’s set a time to dive into some research together!

I'll make a list of some potential groups to check out, and we can go from there. Are you free to meet up then, or do you have any other plans?",
