It's about these brothers, Shelton, William, and David, who grew up in the foster care system after their mom went to prison. I canâ€™t get over how unfair everything seems. The way their lives spiraled because of their circumstances just made me feel so frustrated and sad. ðŸ˜¢ Have you ever really thought about how the system fails kids like them?",

I've been following some similar stories lately, and it's heartbreaking to see how the foster care system can be so inadequate, especially for kids who have already experienced trauma and loss. Can you tell me more about what specifically resonated with you about their story? Was it the lack of support, the struggles with finding stable housing, or something else entirely?",

And the fact that they were never adopted, despite so many kids needing families, is just heartbreaking. Itâ€™s like they were set up to fail from the beginning. Shelton ended up in prison, and it feels like such a tragic cycle. It makes me wonder how many other kids are stuck in similar situations. I can't help but feel angry about it. Do you think thereâ€™s any way to really change things for kids in the system?",

Feeling angry is a valid emotion, and it's understandable that you're wondering if anything can be done to break this cycle. I think it's worth considering that it's not just about the system failing the brothers, but also about the systemic issues that allow it to happen in the first place, like poverty, racism, and lack of resources. That being said, there are some organizations and advocates working to address these issues and provide support to kids in the foster care system. Have you heard about the #BreakTheCycle movement or any similar initiatives?",

I think about how many kids out there are still slipping through the cracks, and it makes me feel so helpless. Do you think there are things we can do on a personal level, like volunteering or supporting local foster care initiatives? Iâ€™d love to find ways to make a difference, even if it's just a little bit.",

Volunteering or supporting local foster care initiatives are great ways to make a difference, and there are many other ways to get involved too, like donating resources, spreading awareness, or simply being an ally to families and kids in the system. It's also important to recognize that you don't have to be a \"expert\" or a professional to make a difference â€“ just being a supportive listener and advocate can go a long way.

They also have a mentorship program specifically for kids in foster care, which could be a great fit. Have you heard of the \"Foster Forward\" program in Boston? It's a mentorship program that matches foster youth with positive adult role models, and they often need volunteers to participate. Would you be interested in exploring those options further?",
