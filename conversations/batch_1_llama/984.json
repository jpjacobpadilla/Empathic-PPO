It's about these brothers who bounced around foster homes after their mom went to prison, and it feels so heavy. I can’t stop thinking about how their lives were shaped by the system from such a young age. It’s just heartbreaking to think about what they went through. How can the system fail kids like that, you know?",

What do you think it is about their situation that's particularly striking to you? Is it the fact that they were bounced around foster homes, the impact on their family, or something else entirely?",

It’s like they were set up to fail from the start. And the fact that they ended up in prison just feels like the system is perpetuating the cycle instead of helping them. Like, how do we let that happen? It’s so frustrating! Have you ever thought about how different their lives could have been with even a little more support?",

I think it's really interesting that you mention how different their lives could have been with more support. It makes me wonder, do you think it's not just the system that's at fault, but also our individual roles as a society? Should we be holding ourselves accountable for not doing more to prevent situations like this from happening?",

It’s easy to point fingers at the system, but we also need to think about how we can support vulnerable kids in our communities. Like, if more people stepped up as foster parents or mentors, it could really make a difference! It’s just so disheartening to see the cycle continue. It makes me want to find ways to help, you know? Have you ever thought about getting involved in any initiatives or organizations that support at-risk youth?",

I've actually been thinking about volunteering at a local organization that provides after-school programs for kids in foster care. It's amazing how something as simple as a positive adult presence can make a huge difference in their lives. But I'm curious, what kind of involvement are you thinking of getting into? Is there something specific that's calling to you, or do you feel like you're open to exploring different options?",

I’ve thought about mentoring or volunteering at youth programs, maybe even working with organizations that focus on advocacy for foster care reform. I just want to be part of something that helps break the cycle and gives these kids a fighting chance. It’s like, if we can help just one child feel supported, it could create a ripple effect. And it’s such a stark contrast to those brothers' experiences. Have you had any experiences that made you feel passionate about this kind of work?",

Hearing about the struggles they faced and the support they lacked sparked a desire to understand the problem better and to do something about it. Since then, I've been learning as much as I can about the foster care system and the ways that we can work to improve it. It's amazing how much impact one person can have when they're willing to listen, learn, and take action. Do you think that's something that's missing for you, though - a personal connection to the issue that's driving your desire to get involved?",

It might be why I feel so strongly about wanting to help. It feels like there's this disconnect between the system and the actual lives that are being impacted. Maybe if I had a personal connection, it would deepen my understanding even more. I wonder if getting involved, like you are, could help bridge that gap for me and make it feel more real. What do you think? Would that help you feel more connected to the cause?",

When you're invested in a cause, you start to see the complexities and nuances that might not be immediately apparent when you're just reading about it. It's like the stories start to take on a life of their own, and you begin to understand the people behind the headlines. For me, getting involved has been about learning from others, listening to their experiences, and gaining a deeper understanding of the systems and structures that are at play. It's helped me feel more connected to the cause, and it's given me a sense of purpose and meaning. Would you be open to attending an event or meeting with an organization that works with foster care youth? Sometimes just being in the same room as others who are passionate about the issue can be really powerful.",

It's going to feature some really inspiring speakers who have overcome challenges in the system and are now working to create change. I think it would be a great opportunity for us to learn from others and meet like-minded people. Plus, we can definitely brainstorm ideas and collaborations over coffee or lunch afterwards.

I'm also thinking that we could reach out to the non-profit beforehand to see if they have any opportunities for volunteers or interns. Maybe we can even coordinate our schedules to make sure we can attend any additional events or meetings that come up. Let me know what you think!",
