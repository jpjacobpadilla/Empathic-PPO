It talks about these brothers who grew up in the foster care system after their mom went to prison. I can't even imagine how rough that must have been for them. It made me feel so sad and frustrated thinking about how the system fails so many kids. I just kept thinking about how they didn't even get a chance at a normal childhood, you know?",

Can you tell me more about what specifically resonated with you about the story? Was it the brothers themselves, or was it more about the fact that the system failed them?",

I mean, they were just kids, right? And to end up in prison later on? It feels like a cycle that just keeps repeating itself. It makes me feel so helpless when I think about how many kids are out there going through similar situations. Do you think there's anything we can do to help change the system?",

I think it's really brave of you to acknowledge feeling helpless, because that's often the hardest part of trying to make a difference. As for changing the system, I think there are a lot of people and organizations working on it, but it's definitely an uphill battle. What do you think would be the most effective way to support kids who are going through similar experiences? Would it be more about providing resources and services, or addressing the root causes of the problem?",

But we also need to tackle the root issues, like poverty and lack of access to education. It's frustrating because it feels like such a massive undertaking, and change takes time. Sometimes I wonder if people even realize how deep these issues go. Have you ever thought about volunteering or getting involved with organizations that focus on helping foster kids?",

I think a lot of people are aware of the issue, but it's often hidden from view because it's not a glamorous or visible problem. As for volunteering, I've actually been thinking about getting involved with a local organization that works with foster youth. But I'm also aware that it can be tough to make a meaningful impact, especially for those who are already struggling. Do you think that volunteering or getting involved in this way can be a way to honor the experiences of kids like the ones in the article, or is it more about taking action in a way that feels more tangible?",

It also gives you a chance to learn more about their struggles and advocate for them. Plus, the connections you build can be really meaningful and impactful. But I totally get that wanting to take action in a more tangible way is important too. Sometimes it can feel like volunteering feels insufficient in the grand scheme of things. Have you thought about what kind of organization you'd want to get involved with? Something more hands-on, or maybe more advocacy-focused?",

As for what kind of organization, I think I'd want to get involved with something that's specifically focused on supporting foster youth, like a transitional living program or a mentorship organization. I'd want to be able to provide direct support and services to kids who are really struggling. But at the same time, I also think it would be really important to advocate for policy changes and systemic changes that would benefit kids like the ones in the article. Maybe something that combines both direct service and advocacy, like a policy-focused organization that works with foster youth. What do you think about that?",

It’d be great to see how the personal connections you make could inform your advocacy work, too.

Have you found any specific organizations that resonate with you, or are you still in the exploration phase?",

One that really stands out to me is the National Foster Youth Institute, which focuses on policy and advocacy work to support foster youth. They have a really strong track record of pushing for systemic changes and advocating for the rights of foster youth. I'm also interested in the Foster Youth in Transition (FYIT) program, which provides direct support and services to foster youth as they transition to independence. I'd love to get involved with an organization that has a similar focus on both direct service and advocacy. Do you think it's weird that I'm feeling a sense of purpose and direction after reading this article, or is it just a sign that it's resonating with me on a deeper level?",

I think the key is going to be prioritizing and making space for this new commitment, while still taking care of myself and the people I care about. Maybe that means saying no to some things, or finding ways to make it more manageable. But I feel like it's worth it, because this is something that I'm truly passionate about, and I don't want to let it slip away.
