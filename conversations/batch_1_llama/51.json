Like, I can’t stop thinking about how their whole childhood was shaped by the system. It’s just so heartbreaking to think about how they were bounced around and never really had a stable family. I feel so much empathy for them. How can someone go through that and still find a way to cope, you know?",

It's amazing that Shelton and his brothers were able to turn their experiences into something positive, like their podcast, My Brother, My Brother and Me. I think it's really interesting that they've been able to use their stories to help others. What do you think it is about their experiences that resonates with you so deeply, and how do you think it's making you reflect on your own life and family?",

I can’t imagine the kind of trauma they faced and how that would affect their sense of self and relationships. It makes me think about how important family is and how many kids out there are struggling in similar situations without any support. It’s a lot to process. Plus, it raises questions about the foster care system and what can be done to improve it. Do you think more people should be aware of these issues?",

I think it's really important that people are aware of the issues surrounding foster care, but also that we're not just talking about it, we're also taking action. There are a lot of organizations and advocacy groups working to improve the system and support kids who are in foster care. It's also about raising awareness about the importance of family, love, and support. It can be overwhelming to think about the systemic issues, but it's also a great opportunity to get involved and make a difference.

I wonder if there are local initiatives we could get involved in—maybe even something like mentoring programs. It makes me think about how we can all contribute to making change, even in small ways.

Mentoring programs are a great way to provide kids with a positive role model and support system, and it's something that anyone can get involved with, regardless of their background or experience.

I think it's so important for kids to have a sense of identity and purpose, and to feel like they can pursue their dreams. I'd also love to be a part of a program that provides support for foster youth as they transition into adulthood, whether that's through college, career development, or just general life skills. It's heartbreaking to think about how many kids are struggling to navigate the system and find their place in the world.

Those soft skills are just as vital as any practical knowledge. It really gets me excited thinking about the potential impact we could have!

I think it's amazing that they're using the arts as a way to build confidence and self-esteem in kids who might be struggling in other areas. It's also a great way to provide them with a creative outlet and a sense of purpose. I'm planning to reach out to them soon to see if I can volunteer or get more involved. I'm also open to exploring other options, like group home programs or community centers that might have similar initiatives. What do you think about the idea of involving other mentors or role models in the program? Maybe someone with a different background or experience could offer a unique perspective and support to the kids.",

As for specific qualities or experiences, I think it would be amazing to have mentors who have been in similar situations or have a deep understanding of the foster care system. But I also think it would be really valuable to have mentors who come from different walks of life, like people who have been successful in their careers or have unique hobbies and interests. I'd love to see mentors who can share their own stories of resilience and perseverance, and who can offer a different perspective on what it means to be a successful and happy person. Maybe someone who has overcome adversity to achieve their goals, or someone who has found success through non-traditional means. What do you think about the idea of having a \"buddy system\" within the program, where kids are paired with a mentor and a \"buddy\" who can provide additional support and guidance?",

Plus, having another peer who understands what they're going through can be incredibly validating. It’s like creating a safety net for them, where they don’t have to feel alone in their journey.

Having activities that are fun and engaging could help kids feel more at ease with each other, and create opportunities for them to build trust and form meaningful relationships.

I think incorporating a mix of fun activities—like sports, games, or art projects—along with more meaningful ones, like community service, could be a great way to balance fun and growth.

Maybe we could even have a \"buddy of the month\" or \"mentor of the month\" recognition program, where kids can nominate their favorite buddy or mentor, and we can celebrate their achievements and acknowledge their hard work. Having a feedback system in place would also allow us to be more responsive to the kids' needs and concerns, and make sure that we're creating a space that's truly supportive and empowering for them.
