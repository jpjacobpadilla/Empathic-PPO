It tells the story of Shelton McElroy and his brothers, who went through such a tough childhood bouncing around foster homes after their mom went to prison. I can't stop thinking about how they never got adopted and ended up in the system. It feels so unfair and heartbreaking. Like, how do you even begin to cope with something like that? ðŸ˜Ÿ",

Can you tell me more about what specifically is striking you about Shelton and his brothers' story? Is it the lack of support, the difficulty of being in the foster system, or something else entirely?",

I can't help but think about all the kids who slip through the cracks. Shelton and his brothers seem like they never really had a fighting chance, you know? It just makes me feel so helpless thinking about all the kids out there who might be going through the same thing. Itâ€™s like theyâ€™re trapped in a system that doesnâ€™t really care for them. ðŸ˜¢",

It's like you're feeling a sense of responsibility to want to make a difference, but at the same time, you're also feeling powerless in the face of such a complex and entrenched problem. Have you ever felt like you're more motivated to try and help or make a change because of this article, or is it actually causing you to feel overwhelmed and discouraged?",

I feel motivated to learn more about these issues and maybe even get involved in some way, but then I also feel that weight of the challenge ahead. Itâ€™s daunting to think about where to even start! Plus, the emotional toll of it all is pretty heavy. I keep thinking about how many kids might never get the support they need, and it makes me wish there was more awareness around these issues.

I think one of the most important things we can do is raise awareness about these issues, like you said. Sometimes, just being aware of the problem is the first step towards taking action. I've also thought about volunteering or donating to organizations that work with at-risk youth. What are your thoughts on that? Would that be something you'd be interested in exploring?",
