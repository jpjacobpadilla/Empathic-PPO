It’s so surreal to think that the state of a country’s economy can affect wildlife so drastically. I mean, 50 animals at one zoo have died from starvation in just six months. It’s just so sad and frustrating! It makes me feel helpless. How can we let this happen? 😢",

For example, we could start with discussing recent efforts in animal conservation or how individuals can help at home. Let's do it! 😊🐾🌱",
