I can't believe that the economic situation there is so dire that it's affecting not just people but also wildlife. It's heartbreaking to think about those poor animals struggling to survive. I feel so overwhelmed by the whole situation. How can a country not be able to take care of its animals? It makes me really sad. What do you think about that?",
