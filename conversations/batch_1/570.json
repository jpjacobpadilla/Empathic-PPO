I can’t believe how terrible the conditions were for the animals, especially the Bengal tiger, Laziz. It’s just so sad to think about them living in such horror, sharing cages with mummified animals. Ugh, my heart hurts. Have you heard about this zoo before?",

It’s like a glimmer of hope amid such darkness. Have you felt that way about stories of animal rescues before? Like they can be so uplifting even when the situation is so dire?",

Connecting with others about similar experiences helps to make us feel less alone in our emotions.\n\nDo you think sharing these stories can potentially lead to positive change?
