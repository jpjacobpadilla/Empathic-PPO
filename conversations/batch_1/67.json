It’s just so heartbreaking to imagine what those animals went through, especially Laziz, the Bengal tiger. They were living in such awful conditions, sharing cages with mummified remains of other animals. Like, how could anyone let it get that bad? It made me feel so sad and frustrated! What do you think about zoos in general?",

It really made me question the ethics of zoos and the importance of wildlife conservation efforts. I think zoos can be educational and fun for a lot of people, but they should always be approached with a clear understanding of the living conditions and welfare of the animals. It’s a tough issue, but I believe that zoos can evolve to be more humane and sustainable if they're held accountable by communities and legislatures. What are your thoughts on reforming the zoo industry to ensure better conditions for the animals it houses?",

It's like, if they could focus more on conservation and animal welfare instead of just entertainment, that would be so much better. I think the attention should be on providing natural habitats and proper care instead of keeping animals in unhealthy conditions. It just makes me angry to think about all the suffering animals like Laziz have endured. It’s a reminder of how important it is to support organizations that prioritize animal welfare. Have you ever thought about visiting a sanctuary instead of a zoo? I feel like that could be a better way to see animals while supporting their well-being!",
