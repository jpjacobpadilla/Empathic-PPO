It's so devastating to think that while people are struggling to find food, the animals are suffering too. Like, how can they be feeding lions and tigers mangoes and pumpkins? It just feels so wrong. I’m feeling a mix of sadness and anger, honestly. It’s so unfair for both the animals and the people there. Have you ever heard about how bad the situation is in Venezuela?",

I know there are organizations trying to help, but it feels like they’re fighting an uphill battle. I keep thinking about the people, too, and how desperate they must be to survive.
