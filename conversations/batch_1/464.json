It makes me think about how quickly everything can change, you know? One moment everything is fine, and the next, everything is gone. It just makes me feel so grateful for what I have, but also so sad for them. Have you ever thought about how fragile life is like that?",

This could involve sharing stories, creating graphics, or organizing a community event.\n\n3. **Local Support Group**: Suggesting they start or join a local support group for families who have experienced similar losses. This could provide a space to share experiences, feelings, and solutions.\n\n4. **Legal Assistance**: If the fire was unexpected and caused financial stress, they might benefit from consulting with local law enforcement or a legal aid organization to explore financial aid options.\n\n5. **Emergency Assistance**: If their situation is dire, offering immediate help (like providing them with necessities like food, clothing, or temporary housing) can be a lifesaver.\n\nRemembering that itâ€™s okay to not have all the answers but that showing support and being there for them is whatâ€™s important.
