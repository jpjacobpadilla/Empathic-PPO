It's about policies, education, law enforcement, and community support. How do policies address the root causes of child welfare issues? How can education systems better prepare students from difficult backgrounds for success? And finally, how can communities rally around individuals who have overcome significant adversity to provide the support they need to thrive?\n\nYour thoughts can spark meaningful conversations and lead to thoughtful solutions.
