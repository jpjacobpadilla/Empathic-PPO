I can’t believe it was called \"the world's worst zoo\" and that there were only 15 animals left alive when they rescued them. It’s so heartbreaking to think about what those animals went through. The fact that some were mummified because the staff couldn't care for them properly just... ugh, it gets to me. How could anyone let that happen?",

And remember, the animals don't care whether you're emotionally prepared or not; they just need someone to help them. Plus, organizations often have support systems in place to help handle the emotional toll. It’s definitely something to consider seriously, and I think it could bring you a lot of peace of mind and purpose.\n\nIf you're concerned about the emotional impact, remember that it’s okay to take things one step at a time. You could start by learning about rescue organizations, the types of work they do, and their support systems. Small steps, like reading up on their mission and maybe even watching educational videos or reading more about their work, can help ease the transition. Plus, your friendship with your friend can provide you with the emotional support you need during this process.\n\nWouldn't it be great to find a rescue project where you could really make a difference? I bet you'd be surprised at how much you can accomplish and how fulfilling it can be. Plus, you could always take your friend along as a morale boost and a source of support for you both. How does that sound? Would you like to find out more about specific rescue organizations? I can help with that.",

It also underscores the need for better wildlife conservation efforts and the emotional bonds these creatures can forge with humans.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to share more about these articles or if you have any other thoughts on the topic.
