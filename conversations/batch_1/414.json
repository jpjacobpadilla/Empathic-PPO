Itâ€™s about these brothers, Shelton, William, and David, who grew up in the foster care system after their mom went to prison. I canâ€™t stop thinking about how incredibly tough their childhood was, bouncing from home to home and then ending up in prison themselves. It just makes me feel so sad for them, like they never really had a chance. ðŸ˜” Have you ever thought about how much our upbringing shapes who we become?",

It's a reminder of the importance of support systems and second chances. I can't imagine the challenges they went through and how hard it must have been for them to break that cycle despite everything. It must have been so hard for them to find even a semblance of stability. How do you think they managed to find even a tiny bit of peace in their own lives?",

I think some people find strength in their relationships or maybe hope for a better future, but it must be so hard when youâ€™ve been let down so many times. I wonder if they ever had moments where they felt really connected or safe, even if just for a short while. It makes me appreciate the stability and love we have in our lives, you know? How do you think we can better support kids who are in similar situations today?",

Supporting kids who have experienced trauma can be done in many waysâ€”through education and awareness, advocating for better policies and resources, and simply being there for them as friends and allies. It's crucial to foster environments where they can find normalcy and hope. Maybe we can challenge ourselves to be those anchors for someone else. And I agree, it's about appreciating the stability we do have and working towards making it even more accessible for those in less fortunate positions.

Also, community initiatives that provide resources and stability, like after-school programs or counseling services, could really help.
