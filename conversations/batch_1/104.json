I just read this really heartbreaking article about the situation in Venezuelan zoos, and I can't stop thinking about it. ðŸ˜¢ It's just so tragic that about 50 animals at Caricuao Zoo have starved in the last six months because of the countryâ€™s economic collapse.

I feel so helpless and frustrated thinking about the suffering of these animals and how intertwined it is with human suffering too. What do you think about that?",
