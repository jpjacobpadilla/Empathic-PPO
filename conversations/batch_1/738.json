Itâ€™s incredible how a country's economy can affect wildlife so drastically. Like, 50 animals have starved at one zoo in just six months!

The link between zoos and wildlife welfare is critical. It's sad to see how the economic struggles of a country can lead to such devastating outcomes for animals. It makes me think we need to advocate for better funding for wildlife protection, even in times of crisis. Have you thought about any solutions or ways we could help?",

I mean, if they had access to their natural habitats, theyâ€™d be able to fend for themselves and thrive. Plus, it could help restore the ecosystem balance. We should really start focusing on creating more safe spaces for wildlife, right? What do you think?",

I know there are plenty of international wildlife conservation groups that are actively working on these issues as well. We could reach out to them to see how we can help or get involved. It might also be interesting to organize a virtual event or discussion about these topics, since it can reach more people. What do you think? Does that sound like a good plan?",
