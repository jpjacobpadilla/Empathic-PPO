It's just so heartbreaking to see how he and his brothers were thrown around the system and how that affected their lives. The whole thing just made me so emotional, thinking about how difficult it must have been for them. Itâ€™s a lot to process, you know? How can someone grow up feeling so abandoned and forgotten? ðŸ˜¢",
