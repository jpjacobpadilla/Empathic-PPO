It talks about Shelton McElroy and his upbringing in foster care after his mom went to prison. It’s heartbreaking to see how he and his brothers went through so much just as kids. I can’t help but feel a mix of sadness and anger about how the system failed them. It makes me think about the impact of childhood experiences on adult life, you know? What do you think about that kind of thing?",

The fact that they were able to carve out a life despite the adversities they faced is inspiring. It definitely prompts a lot of questions about the role of the community in supporting individuals who’ve been through tough times. It’s a reminder that everyone has a story and that some of the most impactful changes start from a place of struggle. What do you think about starting a community initiative to support similar stories of resilience?",

Just having someone believe in them can change everything. I wonder what kind of programs would be most effective, though. Like, would it be mentorship, education, or something else entirely? It feels like there’s so much we could do to help break that cycle. Have you ever thought about volunteering or getting involved in any specific programs?",

Volunteering could be a great start; it would allow you to get involved in the community, understand the needs better, and help make a direct impact on the lives of those who need it most. Education and awareness are also key; bringing attention to the challenges faced by these individuals can help bring about systemic change.\n\nIf you're hesitant to volunteer directly, there might be other ways you can get involved that are more comfortable for you. You could support these programs financially, by donating to organizations that are doing similar work, or by spreading the word about their efforts. Social media campaigns, letter-writing, or even contributing content to blogs or podcasts where the issues are discussed can also be powerful ways to help.\n\nIt’s inspiring to see someone with your empathy and passion ready to take action.

They teach things like financial literacy, job readiness, and even cooking skills. It seems like those practical skills could really help them transition into adulthood more smoothly.
