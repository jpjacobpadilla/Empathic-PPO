I just read this really emotional article about a zoo in Gaza that's been called \"the world's worst zoo.\" It made me feel so sad and angry that these animals had to endure such horrible conditions. I mean, can you imagine a tiger like Laziz sharing a cage with dead animals? It’s just heartbreaking. I can't stop thinking about how much suffering these creatures went through.

It's encouraging to see the international community coming together to protect animals and bring them to a better life.
