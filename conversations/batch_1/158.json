It talks about Shelton McElroy and his brothers growing up in foster care after their mom went to prison. I can’t believe the kind of struggles they faced. It makes me feel so sad thinking about how they were just kids trying to survive in such a messed up system. I don’t know, it’s just really heartbreaking. What do you think about that kind of situation?",

It's important to remember that these are real people, not just statistics. Their stories can be incredibly inspiring too, though. What do you think might help you process this more? Should we try to find some resources to support them?",

I found Shelton’s story inspiring because he managed to turn his life around after everything he went through. But it also leaves me feeling frustrated about the system. Like, what happens to kids who don’t have that kind of resilience? It really brings up so many emotions. It’s hard to see how some make it out okay while others fall through the cracks. Have you ever thought about how different life could be for those kids with just a little more support?",

It really opens my eyes to the importance of community support and caring systems. I wonder if there are any non-profit organizations or programs we could look into to help? Sometimes, just knowing you're not alone and that there are people and resources out there for you can be a huge comfort. Thanks for sharing and for helping me process this. It's important to talk about these things and find ways to make a difference.",

I feel like if more people understood the struggles these kids face, maybe there'd be more push for change. Honestly, it’s not just about individual resilience; it’s about the system failing them too. It's like a team effort — or lack thereof! Have you ever thought about volunteering or getting involved with any local organizations that support kids in foster care? It could be a way for us to help out and make a difference, even if it’s small.",
