Their story is heartbreaking, especially how the system just seemed to fail them over and over again. I can't stop thinking about how unfair it is that they never really had a chance, you know? Itâ€™s so sad to see how their childhood experiences led them down a dark path.",

It's one thing to read about someone else's struggles, but to feel those emotions firsthand... it must be really impactful. Did you find any parts of the article that particularly resonated with you, or any part of their story that made you think of your own experiences or feelings? It's okay if you're feeling overwhelmed by it all. Sometimes just talking about it can make a big difference. Let's keep discussing it and maybe we can find some ways to help them find their path again.",

It feels like they were never given a real chance to feel safe or loved. I canâ€™t imagine growing up like that. I think it makes me reflect on how important stability is in childhood. Like, Iâ€™ve always felt lucky in that sense. Itâ€™s wild to think about how different life can be for others. It makes me want to do something to help kids in similar situations. Do you think thereâ€™s a way we can get involved in helping foster children or something?",

This article really opened my eyes to the systemic failures in the foster care system that these brothers faced. I think we can make a difference in small ways. One thing we could do is learn more about organizations that help foster children. Maybe we can even volunteer our time or resources to support these efforts. It's important to give back and help those who have given us the gift of a stable childhood. Itâ€™s a powerful reminder of what we can achieve when we come together for a common cause. Let's look into ways we can support and make a difference together.",

There are often local organizations that focus on mentoring or tutoring foster kids, and some even need people to help with events or fundraising. I think it would be fulfilling to get involved and maybe even raise awareness about their stories. It could be a great way to honor what Shelton and his brothers went through. Plus, it might help us process our feelings about the article too. Have you ever volunteered before, or would this be a new experience for you?",

It could be a rewarding way to channel my empathetic feelings into action. If you think thereâ€™s something specific we should focus on, like a particular event or campaign, let me know! Sometimes, just being part of something and seeing actual change happen can be incredibly powerful. It would be great to bring awareness to their stories and hopefully help in some way.

I also think it would be a great way to learn more about the challenges these kids face and how we can truly make an impact. Plus, it could be a good opportunity for us to bond and work together on something meaningful. When are you free to start looking into this? Iâ€™m excited to see where this leads us!",
