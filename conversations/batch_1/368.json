Can you believe he was sharing his cage with mummified remains of other animals? It just breaks my heart. I can’t imagine what that must have felt like for them. Ugh, just thinking about it makes me feel so sad and frustrated. ",

It's essential to acknowledge the sadness and the severity of these situations, but it's also vital to maintain hope and engage in positive actions.
