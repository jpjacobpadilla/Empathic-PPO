It’s about these three brothers who went through such a tough childhood in foster care after their mom went to prison. I can’t help but feel so sad for them. It’s like they were trapped in this system that just kept failing them. It makes me think about how much of our upbringing shapes who we become... What do you think about that?",

Additionally, I could use social media to share the article and encourage others to read it. Maybe start a small group discussion or event to discuss how these situations can be prevented or improved.
