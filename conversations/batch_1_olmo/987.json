I just read this article about three brothers who grew up in the foster system after their mom went to prison, and it really hit me hard. üò¢ It‚Äôs just so heartbreaking to see how the system failed them and how those early experiences shaped their lives. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how easily kids can get lost in that system and how it can lead to this cycle of prison and addiction. It makes me feel so sad and frustrated.

It's amazing how these brothers found their way and how their experiences shaped them into leaders in their community. It shows that with the right support and opportunities, even those from vulnerable backgrounds can work their way out of the system. It also makes me want to advocate for more support services and reform in our prison system. What do you think we should do to help these brothers and others like them?",
