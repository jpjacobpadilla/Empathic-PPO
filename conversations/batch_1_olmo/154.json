It tells the story of Shelton and his brothers growing up in foster care and how their upbringing shaped their lives. I can't help but feel a mix of sadness and hope, you know? Like, it's heartbreaking to see how they had to navigate such a tough childhood, but at the same time, Shelton has managed to pull his life together after prison. It’s just... a lot to process. What do you think about how our backgrounds can influence our paths in life?",

It makes me think a lot about the different factors that shape us and our paths. What do you think about how personal stories like these can inspire others and potentially change some of the systemic issues in our systems of care? It's definitely something that leaves a lasting impression and opens up a lot of questions about forgiveness, redemption, and the human spirit. How do you feel about it?",

I think they can spark conversations that lead to change, especially when it comes to systemic issues like foster care and the criminal justice system. It makes me wonder, though, what steps we can take as a society to better support kids in those systems. Like, how do we break that cycle for the next generation? I feel like there are so many layers to it. What do you think?",

I think an initial step could be advocating for better policies that provide adequate support during upbringing and rehabilitation. This could include more accessible counseling, educational programs, and opportunities for positive engagement outside of incarceration. I also believe in the power of community support and solidarity. By telling our own stories and supporting others, we can create a more empathetic society that understands and values the impact of our individual and collective histories. Any thoughts on how we can actively contribute to these kinds of systemic changes? It's inspiring to see how one person's story can spark a larger movement.",

Sometimes all it takes is a small step like attending a community meeting or participating in a volunteer day. If we stick to it, it could lead to bigger changes.

One stands out for its approach to mentorship and support for youth in foster care or related systems: the \"Foster Care Advocates\" organization. They focus on providing mentorship, educational support, and advocacy for foster youth, which aligns with our interest in mentorship and systemic change. Additionally, there's a local non-profit dedicated to improving criminal justice reform, which I think could be a great partner for our involvement in policy advocacy.\n\nI also found a program focused on trauma-informed care for survivors of abuse, which I've been interested in supporting due to our discussions about processing emotions and trauma. It looks like they offer both community-based services and outreach to incarcerated individuals, which could intersect with our interest in systemic change.\n\nWhat do you think about these options? Any particular programs you’ve come across that caught your eye?",
