I can't believe what these kids went through, bouncing around foster homes and dealing with so much trauma at such a young age. It just breaks my heart to think about all the things they missed out on, you know? \n\nAnd then to see that Shelton ended up in prison too, it just feels like such a cycle of despair. But wow, I was really inspired by how he turned things around! He got his master's and is helping others now. That part gave me some hope, but it also makes me think about how many kids out there are still stuck in that system without a way out. What do you think?",

It's definitely a reminder that even in the darkest places, there can be light. I wonder if there are any programs or initiatives we can support to help these kids escape that cycle? It's something I might want to look into further. What do you think?",

It’s like giving them a fighting chance to break out of that cycle. It’s just so frustrating to think about how much potential gets wasted. I really hope more people can focus on these issues and help make a difference. Do you think you’d want to get involved in something like that?",

I think educating myself on the topic and sharing my perspective could also help in raising awareness and maybe even starting something new. It's heartening to see there’s actually something we can do to make a difference. How about we start brainstorming some ideas together? I'm sure there's something out there we can find and support.
