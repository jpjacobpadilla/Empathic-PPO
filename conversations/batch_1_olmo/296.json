Education is keyâ€”especially for the younger generationâ€”who can be inspired to take up these causes and advocate for their protection.\n\nAnd yes, the interconnectedness of all life is something to ponder about. Our decisions and actions, even on a small scale, can ripple outwards and contribute to big changes. It's a powerful reminder of why we must all care for our planet, including all its creatures.
