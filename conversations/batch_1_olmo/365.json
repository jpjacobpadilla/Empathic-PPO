It’s just heartbreaking to think about how those animals suffered and lived in such horrific conditions, especially Laziz, the Bengal tiger. It’s hard to wrap my head around sharing cages with the mummified remains of other animals. I can't believe it got that bad. How can people let it get to that point? It’s overwhelming!",
