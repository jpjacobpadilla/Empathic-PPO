It's so sad to see how their lives were shaped by such a broken system. I can't help but feel a mix of anger and sadness for them, you know? Like, it just feels so unfair that they were dealt such a tough hand from such a young age. What do you think about that?",

It makes me wonder if, despite the challenges, there are some positive lessons they could learn or take with them in the future. It's hard to imagine a scenario where they wouldn't have some level of resilience or strength developed from those experiences. Your point about it being unfair does ring true, though.",

I felt so moved by how one of the brothers eventually found a way to turn his life around and now helps other families facing similar struggles.

Do you think there are enough resources out there to support kids in the foster system?",

The fact that he's able to make a positive difference in their lives is a testament to how impactful these kinds of stories can be.
